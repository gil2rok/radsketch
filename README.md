Implementing all different sorts of ML algorithms, primarily for supervised learning, in python.

My goal for this project is to become familiar with the entire ML pipeline, from data pre-processing to fine-tuning hyper-parameters. I am going to start off by just implementing common ML algorithms. I will work my way up to coding an entire ML pipeline over time, adding completixy to each sucessive implmentation.

Currently, I will be using common datasets, like MINST, Fashion MINST, and Iris. I will later begin to use datasets from kaggle that have (slightly) more complicated data. After I will look for other, less clean data to practice data pre-processing on.

Additionally, I will be learning and using common ML libraries like numpy, sklearn, pandas, etc. I want to gain familiarity with them and expect to use them for implementing many algorithms. I also want to learn about libraries for specific domains/algorithms like KGBoost, Catboost, etc.
